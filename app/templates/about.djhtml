    Yoheng means "travel" in Korean. We are a couple of travel afficionados
    who want to help bring travelers from around the world together as a
    community. This site is a shrine for all things traveling. For now, we are
    starting off with a blogroll feature.

    Good things to come soon! Happy Traveling!
